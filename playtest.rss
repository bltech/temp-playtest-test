      <description>
        We are aware of the following issues:
        - Linux broken as always, game will not start when an USB stick is inserted and more than 2 monitors are connected
        - Hammer broken more or less in the same way
        - Hammer on Linux - don't even ask
        - Localization files have not been updated yet
